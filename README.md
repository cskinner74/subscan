# subscan
Simple tool for checking host information for a list of domains using the 'host'command.
Can extract NXDOMAIN results and export them to their own list for use with other tools.

#cfinder
cfinder.py uses the dig command to find any subdomains in a list with a CNAME entry. Useful to run against the list generated by subscan to find hanging CNAMES on abandoned cloud buckets.
